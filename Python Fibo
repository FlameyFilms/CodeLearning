##The equation is num1 + num2 = sum, then num2 becomes the sum, and num1 becomes num2.
#num1 = 1
#num2 = 1
##The loop of the equation. The number after range determines how much you calculate.
#for sum in range(10):
#    sum = num1 + num2
#    num1 = num2
#    num2 = sum
#    print(sum)

# Your output is incorrect with the above code. 
# Your output is missing the first 3 in the sequence. You should see 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13...
# See the below solution

# Initialize variables
num1 = 0
num2 = 1
count = 0

# 10 iterations of fibonacci sequence
while count < 10:
    print(num1)
    temp = num1 + num2
    num1 = num2
    num2 = temp
    count += 1
